# Overall
Overall I enjoyed the concept of the maze generator but it was tricky for me to design around. Not only to make things look right but also, make everything seem seamless and smooth. I also, didn't have a lot of time to really work on this project due to exams. If I worked on this longer I think I could of made things more seemless, smooth and also better in design. The idea i was going for around the game was that the user is controlling a mouse and needed to get out of the maze.
